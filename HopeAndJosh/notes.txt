The land of josh and hope will be a romantic webpage. Where there will be two programs that you could run in the browser, one a d6 where it will determine what Hope and JOsh Do on a date, the other will be a loop that doesnt end that says I love you to Hope on repeat.

A picture of a babeasaurus would be good too. or lady t rex that I can ask ai to create and I can put the image on the website.

Pseudocode

HTML page with stylizied css
clickable pictures on the left and right of the page of Josh and Hope

Once clicked it will take you to an about me section, with a link that says go home which would take you back to the homepage

It will list the date that they started going out with styled css

Following that 
there will be 3 sections,

2. A running list of movies that we have watched together.

3. How much does Josh love hope loop that goes on and on and on and on, after pressing a button that says find out, which will make the displayed window box run a for loop of so much

AND finally ending with a picture of babe-a-saurus
